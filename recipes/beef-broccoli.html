<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<h3>Beef and Broccoli Ingredients:</h3>

<ul>
	<li>1 lb flank steak, very thinly sliced into bite-sized strips</li>
	<li>2 Tbsp olive oil , (or vegetable oil), divided</li>
	<li>1 lb broccoli, (cut into 6 cups of florets)</li>
	<li>2 tsp sesame seeds, optional garnish</li>
</ul>

<h3>Stir Fry Sauce Ingredients:</h3>

<ul>
	<li>1 tsp fresh ginger, grated (loosely packed)</li>
	<li>2 tsp garlic, grated (from 3 cloves)</li>
	<li>1/2 cup hot water</li>
	<li>6 Tbsp low sodium soy sauce, (or GF Tamari)</li>
	<li>3 Tbsp packed light brown sugar</li>
	<li>1 1/2 Tbsp corn starch</li>
	<li>1/4 tsp black pepper</li>
	<li>2 Tbsp sesame oil</li>
</ul>


<h2>Instructions</h2>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Prep:</strong> Start cooking white rice first so it's ready when the stir fry is done. Cover and freeze steak 30 minutes for easier slicing.</li>
	<li>Combine all stir fry sauce ingredients in a bowl, stir well to dissolve the sugar, and set aside.</li>
	<li>Place a large skillet over medium heat and add 1 Tbsp oil.  Add broccoli florets and sauté 4-5 minutes, partially covered with lid, stirring or tossing several times until broccoli is bright green and crisp-tender then remove from pan. Tip: If you prefer softer broccoli, add 2 Tbsp water before covering with the lid and it will steam cook the broccoli.</li>
	<li>Increase heat to high heat and add 1 Tbsp oil. Add beef in a single layer and sauté 2 minutes per side or just until cooked through. Quickly pull out a piece to test for doneness.</li>
	<li>Add the sauce, reduce heat to medium/low and simmer 3-4 minutes. It will thicken. Add broccoli and stir to combine. Stir in 1-2 Tbsp water to thin the sauce if desired. Serve over white rice.</li>
</ol>
